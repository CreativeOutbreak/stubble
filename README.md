# Stubble
A front-end starter kit from Bearded

## Overview

Stubble is a default set of HTML and CSS that we base every new Bearded project on. It's our "boilerplate". We've also included some of our most-often used patterns. Our goal with Stubble is to eliminate the time it takes to get new projects off the ground and to give us a set of modular, extensible pieces to refine and refactor, rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.

## Sass/Compass, Sinatra and Ruby

**Requirements:**

1. Ruby
2. Sass
3. Compass

**To get started:**

1. cd into your project directory
2. Agree to the rvmrc request
3. Install the project's dependencies by typing `bundle install`
4. Start the project by typing `rackup config.ru`
5. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:9292`
6. Enjoy!

**Helpful Tips**

* Stubble relies on [Breakpoint](https://github.com/canarymason/breakpoint) to manage media queries. Please take a look at the Breakpoint docs before using Stubble for the first time.
